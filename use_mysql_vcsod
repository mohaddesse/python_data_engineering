to load csv in my sql you have these errors:
1. Error: ER_OPTION_PREVENTS_STATEMENT: The MySQL server is running with the --secure-file-priv option so it cannot execute this statement

to solve ===> I solved it using the LOCAL option in the command:

LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE "text.txt" INTO TABLE mytable;

2. UNKNOWN_CODE_PLEASE_REPORT: Loading local data is disabled; this must be enabled on both the client and server sides

solve ====>



1. nano /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf

2. in the [mysqld] section add this line:
local_infile    = 1
3. add to the bottom of the file these two lines:
[client]

4. local_infile    = 1
run this command from my client: SET GLOBAL local_infile=1;

3. error :  ENOENT: no such file or directory, open './car.csv'

solve ===> you shoul write complete adress ==> "/home/mohaddesse/Documents/C#/class/car.csv"
